<h4>Ares is a fully customized Denial of service tool for ethical hackers.</h4>
<h4>Only tried on Linux, not sure about the rest of os's.</h4>
<h2>Read the "MENU" to enable different type of "power" levels.</h2>
<h4>Ares was created by a beginner programmer, so the code looks nasty.</4>
<h2>If you would like to help me, by all means, go right away.</h2>
<h2>Lets make Ares, The God of dos, the best denial of service made.</h2>
<h2>I am looking into making an apk(android) version of Ares as well.</h2>
